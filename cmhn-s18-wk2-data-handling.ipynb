    "# Loading fMRI Data Files into Python \n",
    "\n",
    "For this script we will use a localizer dataset from [Kim et al. (2017)](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2017/01/23/JNEUROSCI.3272-16.2017). For the localizer, subjects were shown faces, scenes and objects in 3 different runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of this script\n",
    "Using this script you will learn to load the fMRI data into python, plot a timeseries for a voxel, and Z-score the data -- an important normalization step for machine learning. General fMRI preprocessing, such as motion correction and temporal detrending, is also important, but has already been applied to these data. You will also learn to use Bokeh, a package for plotting, that will help you explore your data.\n"
